Study Timer is a simple app you need to enter the work time on a daily basis.

The purpose of making this app is to avoid using other apps such as social media, games or etc. So, you can measure the work-time you want to concentrate and enter the time in as many as you want.

Each time, it will give you a rest time. You can set it up at the beginning of the start.

This app includes:
- Enter multiple times
- Update each timer with subjects and hours & minutes (by clicking the timer)
- Delete any timer (swipe right to delete)
- Undo the delete
- Start/Stop each timer when the process starts
